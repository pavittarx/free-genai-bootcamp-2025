# Hindi Writing App
The goal is to build a hindi learning writing practice app. The user will be presented with an english word and the user has to write the corresponding hindi word. 
The word can be written digitally or on paper. The image of the word can be captured and uploaded. The uploaded image will then be analysed for correctness. 

## Technical Uncertainities
- Whether or not an OCR library will be available for hindi language.
- No prior experience with vision encoder decoder models.

## Technical Requirements
- The app will be using Streamlit for frontend. 
- The will use existing lang portal backend for getting words.
- The app will use openrouter AI model for word generation and checking for answers.
- The app will evaluate words for the sake of simplicity.
- Poetry will be used for packaging the application.


The application could be launched from existing lang portal project into its own separate app running on a different port.
