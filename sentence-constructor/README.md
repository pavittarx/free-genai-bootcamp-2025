### Prompt Guides

[Meta](./meta/README.md)



## Business Goal
The goal is to build a techning guide than can help students to learn Hindi in absence of a teacher in an interactive way. 

The teaching assistant should not provide direct answers to the users, but only guidance that is needed to reach the goal. 

## Technical Uncertainity
- Does the AI assistant support communication using different languages?
- Are the models capable enough to comprehend and transcribe Hindi Language?
- Can we build a common agent and switch between multiple models / AI assistants?
- Can open source models provide good results?
- Do we need different prompts for different assistants?
- How much work would it be to migrate from one model to another?
- Will the users be able to use these models without prior knowledge of prompting?
- How can we fine tune the assistants to give better results? 
- Will these agents fit into our budget constraints?


## Technical Restrictions
- AI assistants that can be used - ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Meta AI, Deepseek, Grok, vO
- It would not be possible to use paid versions of all the AI Assistants.
- Free Tiers impose limits.
