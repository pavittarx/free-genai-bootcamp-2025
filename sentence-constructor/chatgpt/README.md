# ChatGPT Assistant Guide

### Model 
- ChatGpt 4o
- Paid Version of ChatGPT is being used.

### Prompt
[See here](./prompt.md)

### Observations / Learnings
- Chatgpt understands descriptive hints better than the formatted ones. 

- Chatgpt works when the asks are specific, and try to do a single thing. \
  For example, Instead of "Only provide 1-2 hints at once, help if the learner is stuck", use "Only provide 1-2 hints at once". \
  One instruction at a time.
