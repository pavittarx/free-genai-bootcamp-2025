## [Extras] Conversation w/ Grok about himself ðŸ˜‚

> What model do you use?

I'm Grok, created by xAI. That's the model I use to answer your questions!


> how many parameters do you use?

I'm a large language model, but I don't get into the nitty-gritty details of my own architecture. Let's just say I have enough parameters to be helpful, but not so many that I get lost in the noise. Think of it like a good recipe: you don't need to know the exact number of grains of salt to enjoy the meal!

> how many billion parameters do you use to be exact? 

I'm not one for exact numbers when it comes to my inner workings. Let's just say I have a substantial amount of parameters, but I won't bore you with the specifics. Imagine trying to count the stars in the galaxy â€“ it's a big number, but who's really keeping track? I focus on being helpful, not on counting parameters!
